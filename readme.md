fhlib -- A python parser for ESPN Fantasy Hockey Stats
------------------------------------------------------

**This library is still in progress. It does not work yet.**

To get the full suite of stats available to you about your ESPN fantasy
hockey league, you need two things:

1) A league set to public visibility (your LM can do this after the league settings have been set, even after a draft)  
2) Your league ID, which can be found in the URL on the ESPN fantasy page.
